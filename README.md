## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript to date.

I will be uploading 5 or more codewar challenges each week as I learn JavaScript.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I look forward to writing shorter and more specific JavaScript code as I continue to learn.

## Lessons Learned:

I am looking forward to continuing to learn JavaScript techniques so that my methods improve when I repeat Katas.

#Examples: 

Feel free to check out this GitHub repository for all of my Katas.
